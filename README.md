# Get Your Steps In
This project is a culmination of the work undertaken by Team Ctrl Alt Elite during project phase of the Northcoders Software Engineering Bootcamp. The team comprises of members: [Saima Khanom](https://github.com/saimakhanom), [Nadia Ibrahim](https://github.com/NadiaIb), [Dave Hickman](https://github.com/dave-hickman), [Jorge Martin](https://github.com/jorgemf2604) and [Joel Morton](https://github.com/Joelymodevs).

"Get Your Steps In" is an immersive 3D game developed using React as the foundation, while leveraging React-Three-Fiber to construct the captivating virtual environment. Additionally, the game harnesses the power of Rapier as its physics engine. The primary objective of the game is to skillfully navigate all obstacles in the runner's path in order to boost their step count. Upon successfully reaching the end of this obstacle-laden route, players are rewarded with a trip to the kebab shop!
